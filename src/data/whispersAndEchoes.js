            "abject, which is concerned with the disruption of the distinct categories between self and other, of life " +
            "and death. As Kristeva notes the abject is a threat to the perception of a clean and moral reality, viewers " +
            "react accordingly to the abject subjects through discomfort. My vessels exist in a space between life and " +
            "death since unlike real meat, their ceramic nature is permanently imperishable, never given the capability " +
            "to rot. Through removing meat’s capacity to decompose, my work defies death and asserts itself as unnatural, " +
            "as abject. Yet, the vessels are not truly part of the living either as they directly mimic something dead: " +
            "the animal corpse. The flesh my vessels emulate have never known life and yet, they perform as a direct " +
            "simulation of the butchered animal body. Thus, the vessels Of Earth and Flesh reside in between human " +
            "concepts of life and death, while simultaneously defying both. They challenge the preconceived notion of " +

            "Using my vegetarian gaze, the <i>Maple Wood Smoked Bacon Vessel</i> came about as I wondered how the cold " +

            "own right, a role I actively oppose in my daily life. Yet, I took pleasure in cutting, tearing, and " +
            "manipulating the clay as I slowly embraced my new position. However, during construction, there was a " +
            "contest between the clay and I, as I fought for the strips to defy gravity when all they wanted was to " +
            "resist my wishes and lazily flounder back onto the table. Although I may have asserted myself as victor, " +
            "the clay’s efforts are never forgotten as its rebellion is highlighted through its perpetual collapsing " +
            "posture. Hues of red, pink, amber and brown are appropriated to render the bloodiness of the muscle and " +
            "fat tissues from bodies not unlike man’s. Additionally, the marbling of fat is associated with value and " +
            "quality as we unknowingly relate the material of meat to ceramics and fine art. The aesthetic value of " +
            "meat may be common discourse in the carnivorous world, but is nonetheless vulgar as the beauty of a " +
            "mutilated carcass is inconceivable and absurd to me. Yet, the shiny, glass-like glaze beautifies the " +
